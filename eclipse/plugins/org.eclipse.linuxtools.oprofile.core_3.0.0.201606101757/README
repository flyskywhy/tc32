An extra step is required to install the plugin (due to OProfile's lack of a user-space mode):

* Run the install script in the natives/linux/scripts directory (must be as root):

		# ./install
		
  * This will ensure all the necessary programs are installed, and create a wrapper for opcontrol
    which prompts for the root password (since OProfile must be run as root). It will also load the
    OProfile kernel module, however it is not loaded persistently. Hence, after the computer is 
    restarted and any functions of the plugin are used, there will be an extra prompt to run 
    opcontrol that would not normally appear.
  
  * If there are any programs missing or an error occurs, the script will fail and display the error.
    If there are no errors, you will see the message:
    	
    	Eclipse-OProfile plugin install successful.
    
    
* To uninstall the plugin, run the uninstall script in the natives/linux/scripts (must be root):

		# ./uninstall
		
  * This will simply remove the same files the install script created.
